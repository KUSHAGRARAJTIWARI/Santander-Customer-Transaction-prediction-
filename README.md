# Santander-Customer-Transaction-prediction
## Data Science Project
In this challenge, we need to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.
This is a Binary Classification Problem under Supervised Machine Learning using AUC-ROC Score for model evaluation. 
Training data consists of 2,00,000 observations and 200 numerical anonymous predictor features, target variable and transaction_ID with no missing values. 
Exploratory Data Analysis include visualization of descriptive features related to numerical features and outlier Analysis. Feature Engineering includes feature addition and Principal Component Analysis. 
Finally, using Light Gradient Boosting Machine with K-Fold Stratification reaching AUC-ROC Score of 0.899.
